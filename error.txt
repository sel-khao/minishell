exit don't update the exit_status of the program and (probably don't handle the cases):
    exit 123
    exit 298
    exit +100
    exit "+100"
    exit +"100"
    exit -100
    exit "-100"
    exit -"100"
    exit hello
    exit 42 world
    if you write echo $? press enter and after you press ctrl+d fd opened
if i only write <<a you don't open the heredoc
if i open multiple here_doc like cat <<a<<b<<c it don't work
    ctrl + \ if done in a command like cat it have to print a new line and after that
    says what bash says
if you use the pipes and after that you exit the fds leaks and and the whole program leak
if you do a ctrl + c after you open a command like cat, wc or stuff like this you print to many readlines
the here_doc don't expand variables(on every line you to check if is it expandable)
cat | cat | ls
the redirections in out have problems(you have to backup the fd of input)
if i try unset PATH and after that i run a command like ls like this it (core dump)
cat <<a > wc - l > file.txt don't work properly
