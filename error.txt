    if you don't have command it have to just add a new readline
    Ctrl+d the program leak 4k bytes
    the exit fuction leak, if you just write exit
exit don't update the exit_status of the program and (probably don't handle the cases):
    exit 123
    exit 298
    exit +100
    exit "+100"
    exit +"100"
    exit -100
    exit "-100"
    exit -"100"
    exit hello
    exit 42 world
    if you write echo $? press enter and after you press ctrl+d ft_itoa leak
    ctrl + d doesn't print exit at the out of the program
if i only write <<a you don't open the heredoc
if i open multiple here_doc like cat <<a<<b<<c it don't work
    ctrl + \ if done in a command like cat it have to print a new line and after that
    says what bash says
    ctrl +\ don't work properly
if you use the pipes and after that you exit the fds leaks and and the whole program leak
cat | cat | ls
